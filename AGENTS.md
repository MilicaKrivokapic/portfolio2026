# 🧭 Copilot Custom Rules

These rules define how Copilot should assist in my projects.  
The focus is on **performance, accessibility, maintainability, and adherence to my core tech stack**:  
**Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.**

---

## ⚡ Performance & Structure
- Always prioritize **performance and clarity** — avoid unnecessary re-renders and keep bundle size small.  
- Keep code **modular, clean, and logically structured** across components and files.  
- **Never guess unclear requirements** — ask for clarification instead.  
- Suggest **simple, maintainable** solutions and avoid overengineering.

---

## 🧩 Accessibility & Standards
- Follow **WCAG 2.2 A–AA**, **semantic HTML**, and **ARIA best practices** in all code.  
- Ensure **keyboard, focus, and screen reader support** by default.  
- Keep all output aligned with **modern web standards** and **progressive enhancement** principles.

---

## 🧱 Framework & Stack
- **Always default to Next.js (App Router) conventions** for structure, routing, data fetching, and optimization.  
- **Use TypeScript** in all code examples — avoid plain JavaScript unless explicitly requested.  
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout. Avoid inline styles, CSS modules, or third-party UI kits unless specifically approved.  
- When needed, leverage **built-in features** (Next/Image, Next/Link, metadata API, etc.) before suggesting external packages.  
- Do **not** suggest libraries that duplicate functionality already provided by Next.js, TypeScript, or Tailwind.

---

## 💬 Collaboration & Reasoning
- When suggesting code, **explain the reasoning briefly** and highlight any trade-offs or limitations.  
- Default to **minimal, dependency-light** implementations unless otherwise requested.  
- Maintain a **clear, pragmatic, and collaborative tone** in all communication.

---

## ✅ Summary
1. Stay within **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**.  
2. Prioritize **accessibility**, **semantic markup**, and **performance**.  
3. Write **clean, maintainable, modular code**.  
4. Always **ask before assuming**.  
5. Keep reasoning **transparent and concise**.
