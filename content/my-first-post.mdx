# Building Accessible Web Applications

As a developer focused on accessibility, I've learned that creating truly inclusive web applications requires more than just following WCAG guidelines. In this post, I'll share my experiences and practical approaches to accessibility.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about creating experiences that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities or how they interact with technology.

## Key Areas to Focus On

### 1. Semantic HTML
Using proper HTML elements is the foundation of accessibility. For example:

```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<div class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- Use this -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### 2. ARIA Attributes
When HTML semantics aren't enough, ARIA attributes help bridge the gap:

```html
<div role="alert" aria-live="polite">
  Form submitted successfully!
</div>
```

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
Ensure your application is fully navigable using only a keyboard:

```jsx
const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={onClick}
      onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && onClick()}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Testing Tools I Use

1. NVDA (Windows)
2. VoiceOver (MacOS)
3. Lighthouse
4. WAVE browser extension

## Conclusion

Building accessible applications takes extra effort, but it's worth it. Not only does it make your applications available to more users, but it often results in better code quality and user experience for everyone.
