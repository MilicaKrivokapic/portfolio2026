# Executive Summary

This case study demonstrates how I report findings and propose fixes. It mirrors the structure of my blog posts for consistency and readability.

## Scope

- Pages: Home, Product, Pricing, Checkout
- Standards: WCAG 2.2 AA

## Key Findings

### 1. Color Contrast

Text on the primary buttons failed contrast (3.8:1). Update the color tokens to meet 4.5:1 for normal text.

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

Modal close button was not reachable. Ensure focus is trapped within the modal and close action is available via Escape key.

### 3. Landmarks and Headings

Missing `main` landmark and skipped heading levels (h2 → h4). Introduce semantic regions and normalize heading hierarchy.

## Remediation Plan

1. Adjust `--color-primary-600` and `--on-primary` to meet contrast.
2. Add `aria-modal="true"`, focus trap, and Escape handling.
3. Add `main` landmark and refactor headings.
