This post tracks ideas, bugs, and improvements for my portfolio. Feel free to suggest more!

## To Do

- Improve mobile navigation
- Add project page for the Accessibility Audits
- Perform an audit to this site
- Write more blog posts
- Test the contact form
- Improve accessibility (always!!!!)
- Add more content to testimonials section
- Make the heart counter work in the production
- Make the form look prettier (delete the horrible gradient)
- Make the text look more authentic and _you_ _:D 
- If you dare, link the older portfolios
- Make the neocities-pages, maybe that way you could kinda be more *authentic*


## Bugs

- Blog post list doesn't update after deleting a post
- The code is insane.... I'm listening to mom's spaghetti and trying to understand. I don't.

## Ideas

- Add a changelog or release notes section
- Tell more of yourself or make a neocities page that reflects yourself more than this
- Try to prepare for the certification
- Check if you need to add mentions because you used the svg's for recommedations
