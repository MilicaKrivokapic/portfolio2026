This post tracks ideas, bugs, and improvements for my portfolio. Feel free to suggest more!

## To Do

- Improve mobile navigation
- Add project page for the Accessibility Audits
- Perform an audit to this site
- Write more blog posts
- Test the contact form
- Improve accessibility (always!!!!)
- Add more content to testimonials section
- Make the heart counter work in the production
- Make the form look prettier (delete the horrible gradient)
- Make the text look more authentic and _you_:D 
- If you dare, link the older portfolios
- Blog translation files
- What do tags do in the blog pages? Should we maybe build a logic to them? :D 
- Make the neocities-pages, maybe that way you could kinda be more *authentic*



## Bugs

- Blog post list doesn't update after deleting a post

**THE CODE** It stares back at you. Indecipherable. Malformed. Malignant.

**INLAND EMPIRE** – 
"Something is wrong here. This isn't code. It's a cryptic confession written in a dead language. You can feel it in your pancreas."

You scroll. And scroll. Lines stretch endlessly. Recursive spaghetti rituals, mocking you, your every idea.

**DRAMA** – “You’re losing control. The structure is collapsing. You're in a wet paper bag filled with semicolons.”

Your fingers hover above the keyboard. Hesitate. Retreat. A beat of silence. Then:

**INTERNAL MONOLOGUE** – "You're mom’s spaghetti. You are the spaghetti. Overcooked. Drooping in existential dread. Sauce? Forgotten ancient agents. Left behind on line 438."

A laugh escapes. Bitter. Hollow. The screen does not laugh back.
You try to understand. You pretend to understand.

**LOGIC** – Failure.
You don't. You never did.

## Ideas

- Add a changelog or release notes section maybe, right here on the blog page, maybe?
- Tell more of yourself here in the blog or make a neocities page that reflects yourself more than this
- Try to prepare for the certification, let chatgpt test you every now and then
- Check if you need to add copyright related mentions to the artists because you used the free svg's for the recommedation icons
