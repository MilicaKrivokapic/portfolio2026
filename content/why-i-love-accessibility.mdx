Accessibility is more than a checklist—it's about making the web usable for everyone. Here are a few reasons why I care deeply about it:

## 1. Empathy

Building accessible products means thinking about people with different needs and experiences. It makes me a better developer and a more thoughtful person.

## 2. Better UX for All

Accessible sites are easier to use for everyone, not just people with disabilities. Good color contrast, keyboard navigation, and clear structure help all users.

## 3. Legal & Ethical Responsibility

It's the right thing to do—and in many places, it's the law.

## 4. Professional Pride

I want my work to be usable by as many people as possible. Accessibility is a mark of quality.

## Conclusion

Making the web accessible is a journey, not a destination. I'm committed to learning and improving every day.
